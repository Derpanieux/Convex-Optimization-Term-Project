    abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = { We present a method for the linear inversion (deconvolution) of band-limited reflection seismograms. A large convolution problem is first broken up into a sequence of smaller problems. Each small problem is then posed as an optimization problem to resolve the ambiguity presented by the band-limited nature of the data. A new cost functional is proposed that allows robust profile reconstruction in the presence of noise. An algorithm for minimizing the cost functional is described. We present numerical experiments which simulate data interpretation using this procedure. }
